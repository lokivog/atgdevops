atgdevops
======

atgdevops is a collection of tools that stress communication, collaboration and integration between developers, operations, middleware, and IT professionsls by utilizing existing open-source tools and projects to facilitate an end to end devops setup and agile SDLC. The focus of this project is to create a devops setup specific for Oracle ATG systems, however the tools and practices configured in this project are not specific to ATG.

Purpose
------------
The purpose of the atgdevops project is not to develop a new application but rather take resourceful projects in the open-source community and meld them together to create a synergistic devops environment. One of the main goals for this project is to ensure simplicity in installation, setup, and configuration. Each tool chosen in this collection maintains a zero configuration setup to run. This project will aim to maintain that simplicity. 

The tools this project will utiltilize are:
Logstash
kibana3
elasticsearch
rundeck
redis

Here is an example of viewing ATG logs through kibana
