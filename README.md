atgdevops
======

atgdevops is a collection of tools that stress communication, collaboration and integration between developers, operations, middleware, and IT professionsls. The project was started for the purpose of creating an open and collaborative devops environment by utilizing existing open-source tools and projects to facilitate an end to end devops setup and agile SDLC. The focus of this project is to create a devops setup specific for Oracle ATG systems, however the tools and practices configured in this project are not specific to ATG. 

Purpose
------------
The purpose of the atgdevops project is not to develop a new application but rather take existing projects and meld them together to create a synergistic devops environment. There are many resourceful open-source projects available to the public, the hard part is finding them and then devoting the time to learn them.

The tools chosen in this project will focus on creating an agile SDLC by establishing open collaboration between continues integration, release management, QA, monitoring, and operations.

One of the main goals for this project is to ensure simplicity in installation, setup, and configuration. Each tool chosen in this collection maintains a zero configuration setup to run. This project will aim to maintain that feature. 

The tools this project with utiltilize are:
Logstash
kibana3
elasticsearch
rundeck
redis

Here is an example of viewing ATG logs through kibana
